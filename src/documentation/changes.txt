This changelog tracks the general events of the v1.0 branch of the pg-python
project.

1.0.1 released on 2011-09-24
============================

 - Fix builds against Python 3.2. pg-python needs to link against "python3.2m".
 - Fix the 'configure' script to work properly on Solaris. (Patch by David Conners)
 - Update tests to specify floating point precision for epoch representation.
 - Parity: register PostgreSQL 9.1 support, and update pg_attribute fields.
 - Add support for CREATE EXTENSION.

1.0 released on 2010-04-22
==========================

pg-python marks a significant deviation from the original PL/Py direction.

 - Python 3 only
 - Functions [are] Modules; entry point based code execution
 - PEP-302 __loader__'s are used to support tracebacks
 - Uses SPI with some extensions
 - Gets rid of the attempt at a rather confusing abstract Call type
 - Improved Database Access interface (some consistency with py-postgresql)
 - Internal Subtransactions are tracked and ensured complete on handler exit
 - Improved native typing: arrays, composites, composite arrays.
 - Removed HeapTuple interface type in favor of DatumTuples/Postgres.types.record
 - PGXS based build
 - Drops support for 8.0, 8.1, and 8.2 (the latter was never released or tagged)
 - Default language name is now "python".
 - Implement interrupt support
